# Capstone Self Assessment

## Part A

For this senior design project, my primary contribution was to the backend of the application. I was the lead developer on the backend and spent most of my time working on that section of the project. This includes structuring the backend, creating a file management system, implementing the architecture and data domains, improving the training endpoints, fixing various bugs, and more. To structure the backend, I applied software design skills (particularly for python) from my previous co-op at SRC. Additionally, these tasks involved applying algorithm design and problem solving skills that I developed through my coursework and co-ops.

This project was also a great learning experience. The most tangible skill I gained was how to create neural networks and work with PyTorch. However, beyond that, my general competency at software design and problem solving also improved simply by practice. I also improved softs skills like teamwork and communication by working with a team and presenting at the Expo. Overall, I think the project was successful. We managed to create an intuitive, complete application that fit our intended use case. At the expo, we also received good feedback from the judges and a lot of interest from other students. Our team also generally worked well together. Our primary obstacles were scope-creep and time management.

## Part B

My group successfully created Check, an accessible application for creating, editing, and training a neural network. This includes a front-end for interacting with models, model architectures, data pipelines, and training jobs. It also includes a back-end to manage all of this data and managing the PyTorch models/training. We also have created a presentation and demo for the CEAS Expo, as well as documentation for our final report. I learned that group work allows for a lot of collaboration and productivity, but it can also be difficult to manage. I think group work allowed for better ideas, a better results, and more specialization. However, there were occasionally some difficulties with managing the work to fit everyone's schedules and keep everyone productive.

Overall, I think my efforts were similar to my teammates. However, my efforts wore focuesed on the backend, so I probably spent more time on the backend than my teammates. I would like to recognize Nate Louder in particular. He put a lot of effort into the front-end and greatly contributed to our team's success.
