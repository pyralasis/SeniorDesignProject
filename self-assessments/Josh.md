# Self Assessment - Josh Lewis
## Part A 
Our application Check is an editor for creating neural networks for amateur and educational use.
I contributed to both the frontend and the backend of our application. 
I primarily worked on the frontend for most of my time with some small help on the backend. 
This project allowed me to work on my skills for frontend web development. 
It also furthered my understanding of neural networks and Pytorch.

My contributions to the frontend were early page design and planning as well as implementing multiple pages in our application. 
Some of my major works for the fronted were the Models and Training page with some minor efforts on other parts along with early planning,.
I had minor contributions to the back where I added neural network layers and assisted with making the backend multithreaded.  
The major obstacles I faced involved having to learn about Pytorch as well as our frontend framework Svelte.

## Part B
My group accomplished our minimum viable product for our application. 
We created a front end and a backend that both individually do what they need to do and work together through an API to communicate with each other. 
We also created a small demo to showcase how our application could be used in a real world example.

During this project, it felt somewhat difficult managing the workload division because our group has five members.
We were able to successfully find a setup that had a good division of work.
Our group was also successful at having regularly scheduled meetings on a weekly basis. 
I feel my efforts were good when compared to my other teammates, Gareth and Nate deserve recognition for their work on the backend infrastructure and frontend design respectively.
