# Pipelines
## Selecting an Pipeline

Click 'Select Pipeline' via the 'Pipeline' button on the navigation bar. Once on the 'Pipeline' page you can create a new Pipeline or you can select an existing one. 

## Using the Pipeline Editor

You can create and edit your Pipeline through the Pipeline Editor. The Editor allows you to drag and configure your data into layers so you can eventually train the model with the data you're passing through.


## Note

We haven't fully finished this part of the project, so we don't have a clear image of how to use the pipeline page.
