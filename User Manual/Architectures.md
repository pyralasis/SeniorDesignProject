# What is an Architecture

An Architecture is the blueprint of your neural network, composed of layers withc specific parameters and connections that determine how data flows in your system 
A Layer is the main componenent that an Architecture is built out of. Each Layer has a set of parameters. The Shape describes how the Layers are connected to eachother adn how data flows through the Architecture.

## Creating an Architecture
Click the create button. Fill in the Name and Description boxes. Click Create

## Using the Architecture Editor
You can create and edit your Architecture through the Architecture Node Editor. The sidebar contains the available Layer types you can use to construct your Architecture. The Editor allows you to drag a Layer and drop it into the Editor.
Once a Layer is in the Editor, you can connect it to other Layers and edit its Parameters.
