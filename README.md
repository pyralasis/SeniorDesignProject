# Final Design Report

## Project Description
This project is a web interface that allows the user to train, test, and use neural networks. We are using the Svelte framework for the frontend and Python with PyTorch and Flask for the backend. We are targeting the implementation of neural networks for both classification and regression problems. The frontend will allow users to interactively create their neural networks using a node based editor through a REST API to the backend. The backend will communicate with PyTorch to handle the creation and training of the neural networks.

## Budget
Our project has not had any costs so far.

## Appendix
- We met for 2-2.5 hours a week to work on weekly assignments and plan/distribute weekly tasks.
- Each team member was responsible for 1.5-2.5 hours of work on their assigned tasks each week.
- We developed a Svelte component package for easy and customizable front end creation going into the second half of the project. [kiwi-nl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kiwi-nl)
- We created Figma mockups for several of our front-end layouts and performed user research on how intuitive and useful these interfaces would be.
- We began work on the front end skeleton project, setting up a solid foundation for us to build upon in the second half of the project.
- We setup the overall backend architecture.
- We added suppport to the backend for creating neural network architectures.
- We have mostly finished adding support to the backend for creating data sources (for training neural networks).
- We implemented a few basic layers to test the existing functionality.
