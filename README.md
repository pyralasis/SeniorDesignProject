# Project Abstract
This project is an web interface that allows the user to train, test, and use neural networks. We are using the Svelte framework for the frontend and Python with PyTorch and Flask for the backend. We are targeting the implementation of neural networks for both classification and regression problems. The frontend will allow users to interactively create their neural networks using a node based editor through a REST API to the backend. The backend will communicate with PyTorch to handle the creation and training of the neural networks.

# Project Description (Assignment #2)
# User Stories and Design Diagrams (Assignment #4)
## User Stories
1. As a student, I want to easily experiment with neural networks so that I can learn how different layers and activation functions work.
2. As a professor, I want to demonstrate the concept of a neural networks (creating, training, usage) to my students so that they can learn visually.
3. As a researcher in industry, I want to easily create neural network models for data analytics without coding so that I can run locally.
