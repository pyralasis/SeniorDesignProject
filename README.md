# Project Abstract
This project is an web interface that allows the user to train, test, and use neural networks. We are using the Svelte framework for the frontend and Python with PyTorch and Flask for the backend. We are targeting the implementation of neural networks for both classification and regression problems. The frontend will allow users to interactively create their neural networks using a node based editor through a REST API to the backend. The backend will communicate with PyTorch to handle the creation and training of the neural networks.
