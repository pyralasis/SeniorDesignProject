# Final Design Report

## Project Description

This project is a web interface that allows the user to train, test, and use neural networks. We are using the Svelte framework for the frontend and Python with PyTorch and Flask for the backend. We are targeting the implementation of neural networks for both classification and regression problems. The frontend will allow users to interactively create their neural networks using a node based editor through a REST API to the backend. The backend will communicate with PyTorch to handle the creation and training of the neural networks.

## Summary of Expenses

Our project had no expenses.

## Appendix

- We met for 1-2.5 hours a week to work on weekly assignments and plan/distribute weekly tasks.
- Each team member was responsible for 1.5-2.5 hours of work on their assigned tasks each week.
- We developed a Svelte component package for easy and customizable front end creation going into the second half of the project. [kiwi-nl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kiwi-nl)
- We created Figma mockups for several of our front-end layouts and performed user research on how intuitive and useful these interfaces would be.

- We added support to the backend for creating neural network pipelines
- We implemented endpoint tests for backend usability
- We implemented playwright tests for frontend
- We implemented several additional layers in the architecture builder
- We implemented builtin PyTorch MNIST data set usability
- We completed frontend development of all required pages and components for workflow
- We connected front-end and backend architecture/pipeline/model/training services
- We created a demo for our hand drawn number recognition model trained using our platform
