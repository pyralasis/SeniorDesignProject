Involves connecting the frontend to the backend. A coherent and pleasant frontend with unit tests and communication with back-end API. Perform user tests against frontend features and usability. |
| 9            | Final Product and Demonstration                          | Gather people to conduct user testing on final deliverables. Use feedback to adjust Neural network editor. Create presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
