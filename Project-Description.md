## Project Description

The goal of our project is to create a graphical user interface for a user to create, build, maintain, and test neural networks to their liking. We intend to make the process of creating a neural network as technically easy as possible to the point that a non tech savy user could spin up one to accomplish their intended task.

## Problem Statement

Building, training, and maintaining neural networks typically require advanced technical expertise in programming, data science, and machine learning frameworks. Non-technical users often overwhelmed by these technical skills needed to create neural networks. This creates a significant barrier to entry, which discourages individuals from experimenting and learning more about the field. A user-firendly interface for the libraries could improve accessibility, allow for quick experiementation, and serve as a teaching tool.

## Background Skills/Interests Related to the Project

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Existing solutions for creating  neural networks are often tailored for developers or data scientists, requiring extensive coding knowledge and familiarity with complex machine learning libraries. There are some tools that offer visual interfaces, however, these tools all have downsides. Some tools are limited in scope - only allowing for certain types of networks to be created (i.e. Convulutaional Networks). Other more capable tools are tied to the the use of a cloud service provider, which means they cannot run on your local machine.

## Approach to Problem

The project will develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to design, create, and train neural networks. Leveraging a Svelte front-end for an interactive, responsive interface and a Python back-end powered by PyTorch, the system will provide drag-and-drop features, guided workflows, and testing environments. The tool will simplify tasks like data preprocessing, model configuration, and performance visualization, making neural networks accessible to non-technical users while retaining advanced options for experienced users.
