## Project Sought
- **Capstone Project Interests:**
    I have worked in both front-end and back-end development and have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences in both. I would like a capstone project in which I am able to make use of both experiences to 1) make an intuitive UI for any interested user, and 2) an algorithmically complex backend that can take advantage of the intricate nature of software development that no one has done in the past. I think a project that is oriented towards making something complex like neural networks or machine learning into an easy-to-use GUI would be very cool.
