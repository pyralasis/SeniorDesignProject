## Co-op Work Experience

- Software Development Co-op (Research) at Siemens DISW (2022 - 2024, 4 semesters)
  - Led a 3-person team to add bidirectional serialization into Siemens NX for use with Generative AI models
  - Invented a novel approach to reference boundary representations in 3D modeling systems where entity order and identifiers are not consistent (currently in process to obtain a patent)
  -	Co-authored papers on project findings, including an invention disclosure
  - Researched cutting-edge technologies via academic papers to explore how they could be used for profit
  -	Finetuned LLMs such as GPT-NeoX on limited hardware using QLoRA and 4-bit quantization
  -	Implemented a constructive solid geometry 3D visualization tool for Generative AI models
  -	Built an augmented sample generator for training object detection models from a dataset of objects
  -	Developed a computer vision system for electronic component recognition using PyTorch and YOLOv5
  -	Created a POC for biomarker anomaly detection with the Tizen smartwatch framework
- Computer Engineer Co-op (Development) at Skyward LTD (2021, 1 semester)
  - Reverse-engineered existing codebase and added vital bug fixes, features, test cases, and documentation
  - Accelerated product components for embedded UNIX systems by porting from Python to C++
  - Implemented real-time inference for anomaly detection on incoming aircraft ADS-B transmissions using C++, TensorRT, and TensorFlow
  - Wrote binary decoders in Golang in concordance with provided specifications
  - Managed Git, GitHub, and Docker for version control and carefully documented code
  - Maximized application portability and long-term support with Docker containerization
- Software Development Intern (Development) at CoverMyMeds LLC (2019, 1 semester)
