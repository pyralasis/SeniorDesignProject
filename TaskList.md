# Task List
## Research Tasks
- Research the configurable properties of neural network layers and enumerate the option types our app needs to support. This also includes researching supported activation functions. - Josh
- Establish a group of testers/users who can give feedback at certain design milestones - Nate
- Obtain a user group to establish an understanding of how a user might want to use the application and how they perceive how neural networks can be used - Nate
- Perform user testing against software interface as the design evolves -Jimmy
 Determine the necessary data transformation operations necessary for feeding most data into a PyTorch neural network. - Gareth
