# Task List
## Research Tasks
- Research the configurable properties of neural network layers and enumerate the option types our app needs to support. This also includes researching supported activation functions. - Josh
- Establish a group of testers/users who can give feedback at certain design milestones - Nate
- Obtain a user group to establish an understanding of how a user might want to use the application and how they perceive how neural networks can be used - Nate
- Perform user testing against software interface as the design evolves -Jimmy
 Determine the necessary data transformation operations necessary for feeding most data into a PyTorch neural network. - Gareth
## Front End Tasks
- Make sketches to generate ideas for potential layouts - Josh
- Develop a color scheme for the front end - Jimmy
- Design a Network Architecture Node-Based Editor component - Josh
- Design a Data Pipeline Node-Based Editor component - Nate
- Design a Model Management Interface component - Josh
- Add epochs information, task bars, and other information that help users understand their neural network -Jimmy
- Make mock components and layout in Figma - Nate
- Implement playwright tests- Nate
## Back End Tasks
- Design and implement basic structure for backend server - Gareth
