# Testing and Results

## Back-end

For back-end testing, we created a series of postman tests, which we manually ran and verified the output. These would be considered integration tests. Here are 5 of the tests:

By the end of our project, we had created 15 of theses tests and all 15 passed.

## Front-end

For front-end testing we conducted manual testing upon adding new features to ensure there were no regressions. We did this testing for major front-end changes as well as API changes with the back-end.

By the end, we had a working front-end that successfully worked with no major bugs.
